# Molecule/Drug Discovery Repository

Welcome to our Molecule/Drug Discovery Repository, where we leverage the power of generative diffusion models to innovate in the field of drug design and molecular science. 

## Overview

In this repository, we focus on a unique approach to molecule generation. Our method involves the separation of molecules into their constituent fragments. These fragments, characterized by their distinct molecular structures, are then allowed to diffuse and self-assemble, creating new and diverse molecular structures.

## Key Features

- **Generative Diffusion Models**: Utilize advanced algorithms to facilitate the diffusion and self-assembly of molecular fragments.
- **Fragment-Based Approach**: A novel method where molecules are deconstructed into smaller fragments, which are the building blocks for new molecules.
- **Creative Molecular Assembly**: The process allows for a high degree of creativity and variation in molecular design.

## How It Works

1. **Fragment Separation**: Molecules are broken down into smaller, manageable fragments.
2. **Diffusion Process**: These fragments undergo a controlled diffusion process.
3. **Self-Assembly**: Fragments autonomously self-assemble, forming new molecular structures.

## Applications

- **Drug Discovery**: Rapid generation of diverse molecular structures for pharmaceutical applications.
- **Research in Molecular Science**: Provides a new avenue for exploring molecular configurations and properties.
